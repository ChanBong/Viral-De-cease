        <h1><u>Common Cold</u></h1><br/>
        <p>The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the respiratory mucosa of the nose, throat, sinuses, and larynx. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days
            after exposwure to the virus. These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. People usually recover in seven to ten days, but some symptoms may last up to three weeks.Well over 200 virus strains are implicated
            in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses being the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with infected people or indirectly through contact with objects in the environment, followed by transfer to the mouth or
            nose.
            <ul>
            <li><h3><u>Sign and Symptoms</u></h3>
            </li>
            The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a cough in about
            50%,while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza.While a cough and a fever indicate a
            higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions.A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.The color of the mucus or nasal secretion
            may vary from clear to yellow to green and does not indicate the class of agent causing the infection.A cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and
            cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks.The average duration of cough is eighteen days and
            in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35â€“40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.
